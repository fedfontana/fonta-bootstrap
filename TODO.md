## Important
- install/change cursor theme to a white one
- install a non-mono font and set it as main font
- install the nerd-fonts variants of JetBrains Mono and Source Code Pro
- check if it is correctly downloading all i3blocks script dependencies
- picom (and other stuff's) installation still asks for pwd ??
- something must be wront with some i3blocks scripts
- gsettings cmds go through but do not change settings correctly
- missing wallpapers and wallpaper setup in i3config

## Medium
- conditionally set the "lid" gsettings stuff if on laptop
- maybe download pop shell in order to have a fallback de
- setup the default gnome session (fallback de)

## Maybe
- add sensors-detect cmd to the script?
- maybe remove ueseless .desktop files from /usr/share/xsessions
- change session names
- rank mirrors by speed before installing stuff
